    /*
    * Well there are a whole lot of things which need to be done. For now I am not doing anything with this  project.
    * Things wish i could have done:-
    * 1| Passing the string to the AlarmPlaying.class
    *       Here, What i need to do is that i need to pass a string from Service to AlarmPlaying which for now is no less than impossible.
    * 2| Having a validation on alarm player.
    *       NoMatter whether you delete the entry. ALARM will always play if it's once set.
    * 3| Proper deletion of database.
    * 4| Adding the alarm indicator in listview.
    * 5| Adding Notification.
    * AND YEAH! BEING MY FIRST PROJECT I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY. THE WORLD SEEMS TO BE A BETTER PLACE. HOPEFULLY I GET A SEAT IN APP TEAM.
    * LEAVING THE PROJECT WITH A HOPE THAT FUTURE SHASHWAT SOLVES ALL OF THE ISSUES.
    * */
